# non-violent_shooter_game
Git repo for a nonviolent shooter game that I am making for a college assignment.

This game is called 'Make Happy.'
The aim of the game is to 'shoot' compliments at your angry enemies.

Use WASD or the arrow keys to move, and left click at shoot. Use your cursor to aim.

Assets used:
'Emojis in Pixel Art' by ArlanTR - OpenGameArt
'Caustion Sign' by pizzaman19 - OpenGameArt
'Top-down Shooter' - Kenney

What I'm most proud of:
The 'compliments' that are played when an enemy is hit are voiced by me. I'm very happy with how they sound and I think they're easily the best part of the game.

What I learned;
Doing this project I learned a lot more about Godot, like how to give enemies a 'sight' field, how to make enemies start and stop following you, how to switch scenes and how to export a Godot game to WEBGL.
Several thing I learned would help with many different kinds of games in the future, not just top-down shooters.

Overall I'm very pleased with how this game ended up.
